Desired Changes:
 * Provide a statistical_categories variable, just like
   categories but used only by the statistics (not sidebar stuff)
   and in preference to categories.
 * Figure out why the AJAX-based Quick feature doesn't work with MSIE,
   and fix that.  (I suspect it's due to the same issue I previously
   fixed in the forum software, and I can probably bring the same
   fix over from there.)
 * After a suitable deprecation period, we should remove support in
   auth.pl for checking the deprecated (unhashed) password field.  The
   hashedpass field should be used instead.
 * There are a lot of "double-quoted strings with \"escaped\" quotes
   in them", which should be convered to qq[a more "modern" quoting
   style]
 * It would be good to add some POD, to make the software more 
   discoverable on the CPAN.
 * The whole thing should be profiled for perf bottlenecks.
 * I have thought about adding a notes table, to allow notes
   to be attached to specific patrons (rather than just certain
   bookings) and appear any time they book anything.
 * Various things are hardcoded that should not be, e.g., URLs,
   opening and closing times, meeting room equipment available,
   some of the stuff in the sidebar, ...
 * General refactoring would not go amiss.  Among other things,
   a lot of actions in the big if/elsif/elsif block ought to be
   factored out to subroutines.
 * Too much of the sidebar is too hardcoded.
 * It would be really cool if it could use NCIP or something
   to consult the ILS patron database.  If we could just
   scan a barcode, and it would look it up and display the
   name, that would be nifty.  (In such a case a field should
   be added to the db for the barcode.)
 * Some of the error messages might ought to be improved.
   A lot of them only contain enough information to let me
   uniquely identify the line in the source that produced the
   error message.  Also, some of them are goofier than is
   strictly necessary.
 * At this time, db.pl only works with MySQL.  It would be
   nice to also have Postgres support.  In addition to
   db.pl, there is some date-conversion stuff that might
   need to change, in DateTimeExtensions.pm, and some
   custom SQL in the gatherstatsforadaterange function.
 * The tutorial has never been written, and probably
   should be, and a link added to the sidebar.
